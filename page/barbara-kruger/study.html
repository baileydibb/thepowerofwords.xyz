			<p>
			Kruger's artwork often consists of a black and white image, sometimes distorted, with a combination of the colours red and white
			captioning the image. This style is very unique to Kruger and was fairly easy to replicate.

			These images were all created through Photoshop. I used the rectangle tool to create the red boxes, and for the text I mainly 
			used Arial Bold as the font, and of course, I made sure it was white.
