			<p>
			Bob and Roberta Smith's work has a rather messy style, however the words are still easy to read. He paints his work, mostly on canvases, but has also 
			painted on things such as cars.

			<p>
			I used Photoshop for my work, which is different to how Bob and Roberta Smith does his work, however I tried to keep the same 
			sort of style, including the text that I wrote on each piece.
